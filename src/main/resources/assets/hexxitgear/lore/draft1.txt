"It is said that a long time ago from blocksmiths\n
and shammens from the land of Exetria once infused\n
a precious gem with the mystical powers of the \n
Hexxical-Deity's. Many treasure hunters have searched for\n
the remnents of the anciant gems for centuries,\n
cut to no avail there seems to be no evidence\n
that the knowlege prior will ever be recovered.\n"
